                    <div class='section_content'>

                        <p>Creating digital music today is far too complicated.  The
                        common software tools offered today are made with multiple
                        confusing widgets, dials and options that can make creating
                        music difficult for even an in-depth user.</p>
                        
                        <p>While creating original music is an artistic, creative and
                        free flowing process, most modern software limits this by
                        enforcing a rigid left to right timeline approach.  This is
                        not well-suited for playing free form instruments such as
                        synthesizers, and also disrupts the creation of a rhythmic
                        beat, forcing the user to unnaturally reason about how to
                        space out notes when they would rather just tap their beat
                        out.</p>

                        <p>Our goal is to break the uniform structure of most musical
                        software tools offered today and provide the freedom to make
                        creating digital music natural and fun.</p>

                    <div class='section_content'>

                        <p class='right_justified'>The design of Canverse was very important to us.  We knew
                        that to successfully solve the problems found with most
                        music-making software we had to focus not just on creating a
                        minimalistic interface, but also one powerful enough to make
                        great music.</p>

                        <p class='right_justified'>The traditional timeline and
                        cluttered interfaces are
                        gone. Canverse presents in their place a simple canvas to
                        play notes on, your gateway to a session full of fun and
                        experimentation. We complement this with a display of both
                        your session's history and the various loops repeating in
                        the background, so you can keep track of what's being
                        played.</p>

                        <img src='images/texture2.png' class='texture' />

                        <p class='subheader'>Synths</p>
                        <p>Creating varied melodies necessitates the use of multiple
                        synths to combine different sounds. To minimize the amount
                        of interface clutter, Canverse controls changing synths
                        using the up and down arrow keys.  This allows you to
                        quickly and efficiently flip through over 15 available
                        instruments, each with unique names to help you identify
                        them.</p>

                        <p>In most modern-day software, controlling synth parameters
                        requires digging around through piles of dials and sliders.
                        Rather than bog you down with this, we isolated two
                        essential parameters and incorporated them right into the
                        canvas.  As you slide your mouse horizontally along the
                        canvas, the frequency of the synth being played increases,
                        while dragging the cursor vertically changes the amplitude.
                        The canvas responds to your movements, showing darker to
                        lighter colors as the frequency increases and fading in and
                        out as the amplitude fluctuates.</p>

                        <img src='images/app_images/canvas.png'
                        class='canvas_image'>

                        <p class='subheader right_justified'>Looping</p>
                        <p class='right_justified'>A crucial component of any electronic musician's repertoire
                        is the ability to layer sound after sound effortlessly and
                        seamlessly, taking simple noises and combining them into
                        something unexpected and fantastic. In Canverse, simply play
                        a note and press the spacebar to immediately begin looping
                        it back.  Multiple notes can be looped by selecting them in
                        the timeline with your mouse before pressing space.</p>

                        <p class='right_justified'>This creates a node on the rightmost column of the window
                        flashing to the rhythm of the loop. This node controls your
                        loop, allowing you to adjust its volume by dragging the node
                        up or down and to toggle it on and off by double-clicking.
                        This simple abstraction provides the flexibility and power
                        necessary to progress your song the way you want.</p>

                        <p class='subheader'>Drums</p>
                        <p>Drums are the driving force behind every electronic
                        masterpiece. Canverse recognizes that your beats and synths
                        exist cohesively and keeps them grouped together rather than
                        force you to awkwardly switch to a separate widget. A single
                        click of your right mouse button on the canvas turns a drum
                        loop on and off. Each row controls a different loop, and
                        flashes a different color as the loop plays. In response to
                        the beat, the canvas pulses, making your software come alive
                        with your music.</p>

                        <p>Implementing this eliminated the need to introduce any new
                        dials or toggles on the interface to control drums and
                        allows the user to add both synths and drum loops without
                        lifting their hands off the mouse.</p>

                        <p>Finally, to allow you to customize the tempo of your track
                        as much as possible, you can increase and decrease the speed
                        of the drum loop by pressing the left and right arrow keys
                        on the keyboard.  As the tempo increases or decreases so
                        does the amount the of shaking on the grid to provide a
                        visual confirmation of how fast or slow the tempo is
                        playing.</p>

                        <p class='right_justified'>Innovation requires experimentation. 
                        For this reason we chose to use the Overtone audio environment, 
                        which is designed to facilitate the exploration of new musical 
                        ideas with tools that allow for fine grained synthesis and sampling.
                        This allowed for fast prototyping of mock-ups which we heavily benefited
                        from during the early stages of development, where fine-tuning audio 
                        parameters could be done without having a fully-functioning graphical application.</p>

                        <p class='right_justified'>One additional benefit to using Overtone
                        is it combines the powerful SuperCollider audio engine with the 
                        Clojure programming language which provides the interactivity and 
                        efficiency needed for a project such as Canverse. This enabled us 
                        to receive instant feedback from changes to the application throughout
                        our development cycle.</p>

                        <p class='right_justified'>After finalizing the audio and programming
                        environment for this project, we decided to use Quil, a Clojure wrapper
                        around the Processing environment, which is geared towards visual design
                        and greatly facilitates the creation of graphical interfaces.</p>

                        <p class='subheader'>Synths</p>
                        <p>
                        At the core of our application we have synths, providing the audio 
                        feedback needed to create the musical soundscapes which our project
                        aims to produce. These synths are the core functionality that is 
                        provided by Overtone, which exposes synth parameters that can be 
                        dynamically updated. In Canverse, just like in Overtone, synths are 
                        encapsulated by node objects which contain information about the synth 
                        to be played and the specific parameters to be applied, including the 
                        frequency and amplitude. Furthermore, Overtone provided the 
                        functionality to bring into the application sampled audio data which 
                        we were able to leverage in order to present the user with a 
                        large variety of synths.

                        <p class='subheader right_justified'>Timeline</p>
                        <p class='right_justified'>
                        To implement the timeline functionality we keep track of the currently 
                        playing nodes and record their frequency and amplitude after each update.
                        This recorded information is then used to control how the timeline will 
                        be drawn; frequency alters the vertical position and color of the 
                        timeline while amplitude alters the opacity.
                        </p>

                        <p class='subheader'>Looping</p>
                        <p>
                        When creating a loop, we read the synth and the frequency and amp values
                        off of each node selected. We use this to create another node whose 
                        frequency and amplitude is controlled to match up with the values that
                        should play at any given point, muting it during periods of silence. 
                        When the loop finishes, its current playback time is reset back to zero,
                         making it play again.
                        </p>

                        <p class='subheader right_justified'>Drums</p>

                        <p class='right_justified'>
                        There were two complications with implementing drums. One was keeping 
                        separate drum loops from going off beat. Our solution was to keep an 
                        internal metronome, provided by Overtone, which we used to keep all 
                        drum loops in time. This allowed us to layer basic drum loops on top 
                        of each other in order create more elaborate drum sequences. 
                        Additionally, using a metronome allowed us to expose tempo to the user.
                        </p>
                        <p class='right_justified'>
                        The second complication was with turning drum loops off. When a drum 
                        loop is initially scheduled, it returns a job ID that can be used to 
                        turn the loop off on request. However, since each drum loop we 
                        implemented was recursive and would schedule itself again after four 
                        beats had passed, the job ID of the loop in progress being kept would 
                        become out of date after the first run, preventing us from cancelling it.
                        This necessitated keeping a hash mapping drum loop names to current job
                         IDs that would be updated each time a drum loop was run, so we could 
                        keep track of the job IDs from the recursive calls.
                        </p>
