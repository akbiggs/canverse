                <div class='section_content'>

                    <p>Creating digital music today is far too complicated.  The
                    common software tools offered today are made with multiple
                    confusing widgets, dials and options that can make creating
                    music difficult for even an in-depth user.</p>
                    
                    <p>While creating original music is an artistic, creative and
                    free flowing process, most modern software limits this by
                    enforcing a rigid left to right timeline approach.  This is
                    not well-suited for playing free form instruments such as
                    synthesizers, and also disrupts the creation of a rhythmic
                    beat, forcing the user to unnaturally reason about how to
                    space out notes when they would rather just tap their beat
                    out.</p>

                    <p>Our goal is to break the uniform structure of most musical
                    software tools offered today and provide the freedom to make
                    creating digital music natural and fun.</p>

            <div class='content_section design'>
                <div id='design' class='anchor'></div>
                <div class='section_header'><p class='right_justified'>The Solution</p></div>
                <div class='section_content'>

                    <p class='right_justified'>The design of Canverse was very important to us.  We knew
                    that to successfully solve the problems found with most
                    music-making software we had to focus not just on creating a
                    minimalistic interface, but also one powerful enough to make
                    great music.</p>

                    <p class='right_justified'>The traditional timeline and
                    cluttered interfaces are
                    gone. Canverse presents in their place a simple canvas to
                    play notes on, your gateway to a session full of fun and
                    experimentation. We complement this with a display of both
                    your session's history and the various loops repeating in
                    the background, so you can keep track of what's being
                    played.</p>

                    <img src='images/texture2.png' class='texture' />

                    <p class='subheader'>Synths</p>
                    <p>Creating varied melodies necessitates the use of multiple
                    synths to combine different sounds. To minimize the amount
                    of interface clutter, Canverse controls changing synths
                    using the up and down arrow keys.  This allows you to
                    quickly and efficiently flip through over 15 available
                    instruments, each with unique names to help you identify
                    them.</p>

                    <p>In most modern-day software, controlling synth parameters
                    requires digging around through piles of dials and sliders.
                    Rather than bog you down with this, we isolated two
                    essential parameters and incorporated them right into the
                    canvas.  As you slide your mouse horizontally along the
                    canvas, the frequency of the synth being played increases,
                    while dragging the cursor vertically changes the amplitude.
                    The canvas responds to your movements, showing darker to
                    lighter colors as the frequency increases and fading in and
                    out as the amplitude fluctuates.</p>

                    <p class='subheader right_justified'>Looping</p>
                    <p class='right_justified'>A crucial component of any electronic musician's repertoire
                    is the ability to layer sound after sound effortlessly and
                    seamlessly, taking simple noises and combining them into
                    something unexpected and fantastic. In Canverse, simply play
                    a note and press the spacebar to immediately begin looping
                    it back.  Multiple notes can be looped by selecting them in
                    the timeline with your mouse before pressing space.</p>

                    <p class='right_justified'>This creates a node on the rightmost column of the window
                    flashing to the rhythm of the loop. This node controls your
                    loop, allowing you to adjust its volume by dragging the node
                    up or down and to toggle it on and off by double-clicking.
                    This simple abstraction provides the flexibility and power
                    necessary to progress your song the way you want.</p>
                    
                    <p class='subheader'>Drums</p>
                    <p>Drums are the driving force behind every electronic
                    masterpiece. Canverse recognizes that your beats and synths
                    exist cohesively and keeps them grouped together rather than
                    force you to awkwardly switch to a separate widget. A single
                    click of your right mouse button on the canvas turns a drum
                    loop on and off. Each row controls a different loop, and
                    flashes a different color as the loop plays. In response to
                    the beat, the canvas pulses, making your software come alive
                    with your music.</p>

                    <p>Implementing this eliminated the need to introduce any new
                    dials or toggles on the interface to control drums and
                    allows the user to add both synths and drum loops without
                    lifting their hands off the mouse.</p>

                    <p>Finally, to allow you to customize the tempo of your track
                    as much as possible, you can increase and decrease the speed
                    of the drum loop by pressing the left and right arrow keys
                    on the keyboard.  As the tempo increases or decreases so
                    does the amount the of shaking on the grid to provide a
                    visual confirmation of how fast or slow the tempo is
                    playing.</p>
